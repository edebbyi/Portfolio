# E. Deborah Imafidon

This portfolio presents my work at the intersection of product, data, and mission-driven systems. The design is inspired by ER diagrams and MySQL schema layouts to emphasize structure, relationships, and clarity.

## Running the code
Run `npm i` to install dependencies.

Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
